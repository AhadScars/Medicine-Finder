            Hello! I’m <strong>Abdul Ahad</strong>, the creator of <em>Medicine Finder</em>.
            I love using technology to make health and medicine information easy to understand for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started this website to help people learn about medicines without confusion.
            Whether you are a student, a patient, or just curious, this website is for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope this project helps people get correct information about medicines,
            but remember, it is always best to ask a doctor before taking any medicine.
